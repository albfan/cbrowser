                                Installation

   Cbrowser is composed of a small number of Tcl source code files.  These 
   files should be placed into a single directory along with the supplied
   tclIndex file.  The main entry script, "cbrowser", will determine where it
   resides at run-time and automatically load the other files as needed.

   The simplest installation is to copy all files into /usr/local/bin or some
   other common directory that is in your executable search path.  Give the
   main module "cbrowser" execute permission and start it up.

   Another option is to store all of the files in a subdirectory such as
   /usr/local/cbrowser-x.x/ and make a symbolic link 
        /usr/local/bin/cbrowser -> /usr/local/cbrowser-x.x/cbrowser
   The application will follow the link to the proper directory and the support
   files will be properly loaded.

   Another option is to keep cbrowser in a separate directory from the support
   files.  In this case you will need to add the directory where the support
   files reside to the TCL_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable.  Be sure to
   include the tclIndex file in the common directory.

                                    Usage

   The whole point of cbrowser is that it simplifies usage of source code
   querying tools, therefore it is designed to be self-explanatory.  There is
   some basic online help available to supplement anything that isn't 
   intuitively obvious.

   You will need either cscope or cs.  These tools are obtained separately.
